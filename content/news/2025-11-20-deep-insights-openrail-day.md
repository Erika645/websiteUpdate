We are happy to  announce that all five openrail projects will be present at openrail day, the first on-site conference of OpenRail association.
From all projects, core developers and maintainers will be in Paris and present their projects in front of the on-site and online audience. 
This provides an excellent opportunity for everyone involved in the railway sector to learn about OpenRail's portfolio and directly connect with the leads. 
Also for the projects themselves, this facilitates a fruitful exchange of ideas turning into concrete collaboration. 
OpenRail Association gives at the OpenRail Day a deep insight to an variety of open source projects.
These are the projects:
* OSRD (Open Source Railway Designer)
* LibLRS (Library for Linear Reference Systems)
* NGE (Netzgrafik Editor)
