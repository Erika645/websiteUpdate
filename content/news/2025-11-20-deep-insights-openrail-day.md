We are happy to  announce that all five openrail projects will be present at openrail day, the first on-site conference of OpenRail association.
From all projects, core developers and maintainers will be in Paris and present their projects in front of the on-site and online audience.   
This provides an excellent opportunity for everyone involved in the railway sector to learn about OpenRail's portfolio and directly connect with the leads. 
Also for the projects themselves, this facilitates a fruitful exchange of ideas turning into concrete collaboration.   
These are the projects:
* **Open Source Railway Designer (OSRD)** is a web application designed to simulate and visualize train capacity on prospective infrastructures, supporting both operational studies and short term capacity management.
* **Library for Linear Reference Systems (LibLRS)** is a library to manipulate linear coordinates and convert them from and to geographical coordinates. It helps to localize objects along curves (e.g. signals on a train track)
* **Netzgrafik Editor (NGE)** is a mature tool used in long-term planning for creating and analyzing regular-interval timetables at a macroscopic level of detail.
  It's versatile for timetable planning in various modes of transport. Features include interactive editing, graphic timetables, train run editing, and analysis.     
* **Rail Condition Monitoring (RCM OSS)** by SBB comprises a suite of products for Rail Condition Monitoring. The aim of RCM OSS (open source software) is to make rail condition data easy to access, store and visualize. 
* **Digital Automatic Coupling Migration Decision Support System (DAC Migration DSS)**
  The Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC) will be the major move towards competitive and digital rail traffic. There is widespread consensus that the roll-out of the DAC should be supported. But how to migrate
  about 500,000 freight wagons as well as locomotives and maintenance vehicles from the current screw-coupler to the modern DAC? This is where the DAC Migration DSS comes into play. DSS stands for Decision Support System.
